# 🔐 Smart Contract Wallet Recovery

## 📌 Project Description

The **Smart Contract Wallet Recovery** project is a decentralized wallet system built on Ethereum that introduces a secure, trustless recovery mechanism. It enables users to assign trusted guardians who can help recover wallet access in case of lost private keys — eliminating the need for centralized custodians or risky seed phrase storage.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Our vision is to make blockchain wallet usage as secure and user-friendly as traditional banking, without compromising on decentralization. This project aims to tackle the long-standing problem of wallet key loss by empowering users with a community-driven recovery mechanism built into the smart contract itself.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🔐 **Decentralized Ownership:** No central authority, full control to the user.
- 👥 **Guardian-Based Recovery:** Assign trusted addresses as guardians for backup recovery.
- ✅ **Multi-Signature Approval:** Ownership can be recovered after a majority of guardians approve.
- 💸 **Wallet Functions:** Send and receive ETH securely through the contract.
- 🧩 **Guardian Management:** Add or remove guardians anytime.
- 🧾 **Event Logging:** Transparent logs of votes, transfers, and updates for auditability.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 📲 **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)** support for gasless transactions.
- 🎨 **Frontend DApp** for intuitive recovery initiation and guardian interaction.
- 🛡️ **Time-Lock Recovery:** Add optional time delays before ownership is transferred.
- 🔄 **Token Support:** Extend to support ERC-20 and ERC-721 (NFT) transfers.
- 🔧 **Custom Thresholds:** Dynamic voting logic based on number of guardians.
- 📡 **Decentralized Storage Integration:** Backup guardian list with IPFS or Arweave.
